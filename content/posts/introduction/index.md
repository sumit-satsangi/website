### Old Content:

<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>his marks the first day in a long time that I am writing something directly over Internet. No filters and no preparation. Only a couple of tweaks and here I am, brutal to myself, open to all. 
</p>
The last time I wrote on Internet, other than the silly emails was way back in 2007. Then the life changed so as me. Here is 2021, the pandemic and me. Boys need hobbies.</p>
Last I checked, I was a full-time husband and a father. Along with that, I am a part time dreamer. Looking at a lot of videos talking about writing something on a daily basis or publish some you tube channels made me think that:

1. I am no expert in the area I will pick.
2. Why would anyone listen to/ read someone who isn’t an Expert on the subject
3. Will it ever be successful?
4. What if it fails?
5. …and a lot of crappy reasons of not giving out some time to kick off the journey.

And then I saw Ali Abdaal talking about writing (and possibly become a millionaire):
