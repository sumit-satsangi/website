### Old Content:

</br> [T]{.firstcharacter}his marks the first day in a long time that I am writing something directly over Internet. No filters and no preparation. Only a couple of tweaks and here I am, brutal to myself, open to all.

</p>

The last time I wrote on Internet, other than the silly emails was way back in 2007. Then the life changed so as me. Here is 2021, the pandemic and me. Boys need hobbies.

</p>

Last I checked, I was a full-time husband and a father. Along with that, I am a part time dreamer. Looking at a lot of videos talking about writing something on a daily basis or publish some you tube channels made me think that:

1.  I am no expert in the area I will pick.
2.  Why would anyone listen to/ read someone who isn’t an Expert on the subject
3.  Will it ever be successful?
4.  What if it fails?
5.  …and a lot of crappy reasons of not giving out some time to kick off the journey.

And then I saw Ali Abdaal talking about writing (and possibly become a millionaire):

</br> Now, as a sensible adult, I started watching it from education standpoint just to realize whom I am fooling around.

So, I got out of my ever procrastinating slumber and wrote this piece of junk.

Let me know how this looks like. I am just a newbie (oldbie, to be precise) in this area and hopefully can provide my contribution back to the society while I am also learning a thing or two.

I will try to keep uploading new content now and then. Strictly speaking, there is no agenda as of now. So don’t know if I would be categorizing anything on the website. Eventually, it will come though.

### New Content:

</br> How can a blog on a markdown website not have an R Code

```{bash}
x <- "Hello World!"
print(x)
```

So long!

Stay safe, stay with family, wear mask!!!

above all, keep smiling and keep learning…
